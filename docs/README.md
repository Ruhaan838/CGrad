# Cgrad Tensor (or any Tensor)

## Introduction

- What is **Tensor**? <br>
    - **A Mathematician**: <br>
    **[Tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor)** are partial derivatives and gradients that transform with the [Jacobian Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant).

    - **A Programmer:** <br>
    **Tensors** are Multidimensional Array.


- Why are Tensors Important In Machine Learning?

- Yeah! This is right the Machine Learning and Deep Learning is all about the Linear Algebra.
- For just quick Idea is that the hole Neural Network ([NN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network)) is just Bunch of Matrix Multiplication stuff.
- So, the Basic thing: If you know linear algebra, you can code the GPT completely from scratch, but this is the wrong way to do this. So, the `PyTorch, TensorFlow, TinyGrad, CGrad, etc.. ' library helps you not write the Full matrix multiplication code for a Neural Network.
